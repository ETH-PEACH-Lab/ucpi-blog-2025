# Learning to Code with AI: Helpful Tool or Illusion of Understanding?

If you have taken a programming course recently, chances are that you have used an AI tool to generate or explain code. Tools such as ChatGPT are increasingly integrated into how students learn, debug, and experiment. For many students (myself included), AI can reduce frustration and make it easier to move forward when stuck.

At the same time, I have noticed an uncomfortable pattern. There are moments when I feel confident after reading and running AI-generated code, yet struggle to reproduce the same logic independently later. This raises an important question: does using AI to generate solutions actually strengthen understanding, or can it create a misleading sense of mastery?

Recent research suggests that this tension is not just anecdotal but reflects deeper design challenges in how tutorials, notebooks, and AI systems support learning.

## Why Traditional Tutorials Often Miss Where Students Struggle

A common assumption about programming tutorials is that if instructions are clear, learning will follow. However, tutorials are typically static documents. Once published, they cannot observe how students interact with them or where confusion occurs.

The Porta system, introduced by Mysore and Guo, proposes “tutorial profiling” as a way to address this limitation [1]. Porta tracks how learners navigate a tutorial webpage, what commands they execute, and what errors they encounter. The goal is not to evaluate students but to provide feedback to tutorial creators about real points of difficulty.

One key issue highlighted in this work is the “expert blind spot,” where instructors unintentionally omit steps or assume background knowledge because they no longer remember what it feels like to be a beginner [1]. As a student, this resonates strongly. Many tutorial frustrations arise not from dramatic conceptual gaps, but from small, implicit assumptions about setup, environment, or prior experience.

This problem is not new. Educational research has long emphasized that understanding how learners actually interact with instructional material is essential for improving it. Yet in programming, we often treat tutorials as finished products rather than evolving systems shaped by user behavior.

## AI-Generated Code and the Illusion of Learning

While Porta focuses on improving tutorials from the outside, recent research has examined how learners engage with AI-generated code itself. Kazemitabaar et al. investigate how students interact with solutions produced by large language models and introduce the concept of the “illusion of learning” [2].

The concern is not that AI provides incorrect code. In fact, AI often generates functional and well-structured solutions. The issue is that students may read and run these solutions, feel that they understand them, and move on without deeply processing the underlying reasoning.

The researchers explored multiple techniques designed to increase cognitive engagement with AI-generated code [2]. Rather than removing AI assistance, they introduced structured interactions such as requiring students to trace execution, predict variable values, fix injected errors, or reason through the next step in an algorithm before revealing the corresponding line of code.

One particularly effective technique guided learners step by step through the reasoning process before displaying each line of the solution [2]. This approach shifts the focus from consuming an answer to constructing the logic that leads to it.

The findings show that students’ perceived understanding after using AI does not always align with their actual performance on subsequent tasks without AI assistance [2]. This mismatch suggests that ease of use can sometimes mask shallow engagement.

## Active Engagement Has Always Mattered

Concerns about passive learning did not start with AI. In computing education research, active engagement has long been associated with better learning outcomes. The ICAP framework, for example, distinguishes between passive, active, constructive, and interactive engagement, arguing that deeper forms of engagement lead to stronger learning gains [3].

Several established techniques reflect this idea. Parsons problems require learners to reorder scrambled lines of code rather than writing programs from scratch, encouraging reasoning about structure without overwhelming them with syntax [4]. Code tracing exercises, where students step through execution and predict variable values, are also widely used to develop understanding of program behavior.

Tools such as Python Tutor make program execution visible by showing changes in memory state step by step, helping learners build mental models of how code actually runs [5]. These approaches emphasize that understanding comes not from seeing a correct answer, but from engaging with the process that produces it.

What is interesting about recent AI research is that it does not reject these principles. Instead, it adapts them. Rather than asking whether students should use AI, it asks how interaction with AI can be structured so that it promotes analysis, explanation, and prediction instead of simple acceptance of generated solutions.

## Rethinking Tutorials and AI as Learning Interfaces

Taken together, the Porta system and the cognitive engagement techniques suggest a broader shift in how we think about programming education tools.

Traditional tutorials often lack visibility into real learner struggles. AI tools, while powerful, can reduce the cognitive effort required to construct solutions. Both systems influence how learning unfolds, but neither guarantees understanding by default.

This suggests that tutorials and AI systems should be treated not merely as content delivery mechanisms, but as interfaces that shape cognitive processes. Small design choices, such as prompting a prediction before revealing code or surfacing common failure points, can significantly alter how deeply a learner engages with material.

For students, this also highlights a personal responsibility. The way AI is used matters. Reading and executing code is not the same as reasoning through it. Deliberate engagement, even when not strictly required, may be necessary to convert exposure into durable knowledge.

## Looking Ahead

AI-assisted programming is unlikely to disappear. If anything, it will become more integrated into educational platforms and development environments. The key question is how these tools can be designed to support learning rather than simply accelerate output.

Research points toward hybrid approaches in which AI systems incorporate structured engagement mechanisms, and tutorials adapt based on real learner behavior [1][2]. At the same time, decades of work in computing education remind us that deep learning requires active cognitive involvement [3][4][5].

For students like myself, this means being more reflective about how I interact with generated code. Efficiency is valuable, especially under time pressure. But genuine understanding requires effort. The goal should not only be to produce working programs, but to build the ability to reason about them independently.
